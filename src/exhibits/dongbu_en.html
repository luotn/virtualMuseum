        The Domu pot comes from the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic areas and is generally used to hold butter tea. It is usually made of wood or metal.
        The Domu pot is called "Lemu" in Tibetan, "Dongbu pot" in Mongolian, and "Domu pot" in the central area.
        Porcelain Domu pots first appeared in the Yuan Dynasty and became popular again during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty.
        In the Yuan Dynasty, Jingdezhen kilns produced blue and white and blue and white porcelain varieties. The Yuan Dynasty vessels were smaller in shape and had handles.
