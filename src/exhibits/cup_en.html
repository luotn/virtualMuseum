    <h2>Cup of Justice (Replica)</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The Cup of Justice operates on the siphon principle. A dragon is rised from the cup. There is a small hole at the base of the dragon's neck and a hole at the bottom of the cup. There are multiple tubes in the dragon's neck. The upper part of the outer tube is connected with the inner tube. The outer tube opens a small hole in the cup, while the inner tube is connected to the hole outside the cup.</p>
    <p>If the water added does not exceed the upper opening of the inner and outer tubes, the cup will be the same as a regular cup; if the water surface exceeds the upper opening, the water will fill the space between the inner and outer tube walls, and the water will completely flow out through the inner tube.</p>
